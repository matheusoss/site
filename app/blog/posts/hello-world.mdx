I decided to start posting about my daily life and the things that catch my attention.

Today, I'm starting this little "blog" of mine. From now on, I want to use this space to record my thoughts and discoveries from everyday life. 

Right now, I'm building an app for the Brazilian capital market. At first, I thought it would be easier, but as time went on, I realized how complex it is to build apps on your own.

Doubts come up, and so do fears and insecurities. The fear of failure is real, but the dream and the desire to make it happen are stronger — and that’s where I find comfort. Maybe this is where I’m rediscovering my competitive side: the drive to beat my own self every day. To overcome my fears, my doubts, and my insecurities.

I want to start posting at least once a week, summarizing what this new challenge has been like.
