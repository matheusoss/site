I'm a Brazilian software and data engineer based in ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· SÃ£o Paulo, SÃ£o Paulo. I love creating amazing software that delights users and reinvents the way we interact with technology.

I'm currently working on a new challenge with Brokerpe, where I focus on simplifying the Brazilian capital markets through technology. Outside of business hours, I explore new ideas (mostly native AI applications) and develop open source software. If you like my work with OSS, you can sponsor me.

I maintain a small email list where I share sporadic updates on my projects and news. Join if you're interested!

I'm most active on [X](https://x.com/matheusoss_) and [GitHub](https://github.com/matheusoss) if you want to chat or see what I'm up to.
